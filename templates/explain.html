      <p>Q: Why built Open Source Jobs</p>
      <p>A: When I contributed to django, I meet great people like Tim Graham and Simon Charette, they are both excellent engineers and always nice to the newbie. I'm sure they are great employees that every company searching for as well as everyone will love to work with them. Products just time to time, long live open source.</p>
